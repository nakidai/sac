NAME
     sac - simple anonymous chat

SYNOPSIS
     sacd(1) -- simple anonymous chat daemon
     sacr(1) -- simple anonymous chat reader

DESCRIPTION
     sac is a simple idea that allows you to hide the message recipient when
     chatting.	This is done using broadcasting.  By design traffic in sac is
     encrypted using sacr(1) (2048-bit RSA), but any other method can be used
     -- this implementation is just a reference.
